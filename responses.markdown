Tony 
    You see everything that's going on around you. You stay 5 moves ahead of others, enabling you to take advantage of situations others may not recognize. A lover of animals, you'd pick your race horse over a misbehaving memeber of the family any day.

Carmela 
    Family is everything to you, and nothing will stop you from making sure they get what is best for them. Loyalty is just one of many unmatched qualities. 

Adriana
    You put others before yourself, sometimes to your own detriment. Watch out for red flags in your potential mates; run before it's too late. You take pride in your appearance and have a passion for music. You will have a pet who becomes one of the loves of your life if you don't already.

Christopher 
   When TLC said "don't go chasing waterfalls" this may be who they were talking about. You put family first, most of the time. In fact, some claim your success is a result of nepitism, but you know better. Be careful changing the music in your car late at night.

Janice
    You might have a dark secret, but nobody will find out if you disappear for awhile. You're a scrapper and somehow manage to come out on top whenever you have troubles. 

Johnny
    You are usually a pragmatic person and the go to for settling disputes. Don't your temper get the best of you though!

Junior
    You can croon like the best of them and plot like the rest of them. You are very strategic, hold a grudge, and like to get revenge. 

Livia
    You gave your life to your children and they dont appreciate it at all. You're also the only person in the family who doesn't curse. 

Melfi
    You're conflicted by duty and and the excitement of power. Most days are pretty normal, but watch out for a call about needing to go on the lamb.

Paulie
    Remember, gossip has it's costs. Don't tell the business to anyone outside of the family.

Sil
    Sometimes being the boss isn't all it's cracked up to be. There's nothing wrong with being second in command. Besides, you can still skim off the top from where you are.

AJ
    Don't worry about trying too hard at any one thing. If you wait long enough someone will hand you opportunities that you probably don't deserve.
